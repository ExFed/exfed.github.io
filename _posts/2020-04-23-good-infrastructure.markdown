title:  "Good Infrastructure Is Like..."

Today, while on a walk among some local farm fields, I got to admiring one of
the ridges that delimits our little valley. As mild as it is compared to some
places, the topography here has been one of the things I really appreciate
about our home. Just like most mid-Atlantic ridges, it's covered in forest and
only subtly impressive. One ever-present feature, however, did happen to catch
my eye: the not-so-subtle high-voltage power lines snaking their way up and
over the ridge's crest. It's not that I'd never noticed them &mdash; it's just
that, on this particular walk, they presented themselves as a reminder what
good infrastructure (e.g. electricity, plumbing, roadways, air traffic control)
actually looks like.

It seems to me that good infrastructure is like clean water or good coffee: you
rarely know you need it until you have it, and you rarely appreciate it until
it's gone.

So that means, as an engineer concerned with designing infrastructure, the
highest praise I could receive is being told that my designs are invisible,
forgotten, or otherwise taken for granted. Why did I ever choose this thankless
field, again?
