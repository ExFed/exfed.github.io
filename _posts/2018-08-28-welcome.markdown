Whilst navigating the turbulent waters of the internet, you happen upon an island. This island appears fresh yet unchanging, covered in a sheet of unremarkable sand. What mysteries lie within? Probably none. You move on.

# In other words...

This is a first post. There's really nothing of value here other than a welcome page. It may so happen that I post something of value in the near future, but don't hold your breath.

Regardless, your presence is welcome!
